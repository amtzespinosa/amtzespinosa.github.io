A tool developed in Python for enumerating and scanning **WordPress** websites. It is an easy-to-use tool that can be run from the command line. **[WPyScan](https://github.com/amtzespinosa/wpyscan)** can enumerate and find any vulnerability associated with **version**, **theme** and **plugins** installed.

## Features
- **FREE UNLIMITED** API queries
- **WordFence** WordPress Vulnerability Database
- **Brute Force** enumeration available for almost any check
- **WAF Bypass** with random user agents by default
- **Measures for CAPTCHA avoidance**

> **WARNING**
>
> **WPyScan has been launched but not thoroughly tested.** Please, open any issue you encounter and help improve the tool. The code is dirty and full of bad practices. I am not a developer but a hacker. If you want to contribute, you are welcome.

> Due to the many scans performed and the avoidance of security measures implemented by the websites, scans are slow. Be patient.
