I have decided to get the OSCP certification and to post all my progress, study resources used and steps taken in this post so anybody interested can follow along or use it to widen his knowledge.

## Background

I'm not a newbie neither an expert. Let's say I'm an intermediate level pentester learning everyday. I got my CompTIA A+ years ago and recently got my CEH and CCST in Networking and Cybersecurity. So for me the beginning of this OSCP learning path will serve as a refresher of the basics.

I have already solved many OSCP-like CTFs and hacking challenges but still there are many more to solve so I will post the write-ups and index all those posts here.

## How this post will be organised

I have decided to structure the learning following the **12 week OSCP learning plan by OffSec** - you can find it [here](https://help.offsec.com/hc/en-us/articles/15541765522196-OffSec-PEN-200-Learning-Plan-12-Week-#h_01H0KWJ0351T94C08S37WHCF0A). This post will serve as an index/checklist and recap of the most important stuff of the entire process as well as an index for interesting material, resources and general guidelines.

Of course there would be some changes to the plan. Every week I will use the "Overview and Study Approach" hours to find out relevant material and resources for that week. Each week will have it's own post for further explanation and assessment.
