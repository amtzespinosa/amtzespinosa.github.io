### <a href="https://github.com/amtzespinosa/python-hacking-tools">Python Hacking Tools</a>

One of the most valuable skills as a Red Team Operator is the ability to build your own tools. During my learning path to the PCEP and later the PCAP I started coding my own Python hacking toolkit. I keep adding tools to this project as I code them - generally during my job as a red teamer.

### <a href="https://github.com/amtzespinosa/password-manager-gui">#PassMan</a>

A simple password generator and manager coded in less than 24h. straight using Python and SQLite3. The strong point is the GUI using CustomTkinter. Reach me if you want to join this project! **Still under development and looking for coder partners!**
