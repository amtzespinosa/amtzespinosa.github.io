### <a href="https://github.com/amtzespinosa/passman">#passman</a>

**#passman** is a password generator and manager built using Python and SQLite3. It has a nice GUI made with **Tkinter** and  **CustomTkinter**.

It's not a final version as I coded it as a 24h. straight coding challenge. The installation is not a proper installation process and it's not correct by any means. The point of this repo is to share it with the community and see how far can it go with other's modifications. Please, feel free to fork it and share your improvements.

### [>_ Sheller](/projects/sheller/)

**Sheller** is a simple Online Reverse Shell Generator built using **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**. 

I have based this project on the amazing **[RevShells](https://www.revshells.com/)** that supports way more languages and variants of all type of shells. I just wanted this project to be as simple as possible although I'm thinking of adding more features.

### [Fingerprinter](/projects/fingerprinter/)

**Fingerprinter** is a simple Browser Fingerprinter built using **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**. 

I have based this project on **[FingerprintJS](https://fingerprintjs.github.io/fingerprintjs//)** but adding some extra features out of the scope of browser fingerprinting as a PoC of how much data can be easily gathered from a client when visiting a website.

### <a href="https://github.com/amtzespinosa/python-hacking-tools">Python Hacking Tools</a>

One of the most valuable skills as a Red Team Operator is the ability to build your own tools. During my learning path to the PCEP and later the PCAP I started coding my own Python hacking toolkit. I keep adding tools to this project as I code them - generally during my job as a red teamer.
